# Hi there üëã

I'm Siliveru Harini üåü
Passionate engineering student | Creative Thinker | Lifelong Learner

## üöÄ About Me :)
I am a passionate student and early-career developer with a strong focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 
I love building intelligent systems that can interact naturally with humans, such as voice assistants and AI-powered applications.
Currently, I am deeply engaged in developing advanced AI projects, exploring neural network architectures, and integrating large language models.
My specialties include Python programming, natural language processing, speech recognition, and deploying AI models both locally and in cloud environments.
I enjoy hands-on coding challenges, continuous learning, and staying up-to-date with cutting-edge AI research.
In addition to technical development, I actively prepare for professional certifications, contribute to academic projects, and create detailed documentation and presentations to share knowledge effectively.

## üíª Skills
Languages: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
Technologies: AI, Web Development, Git, SQL

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
- **JARVIS AI Assistant**: JARVIS AI Assistant is a powerful, bilingual desktop voice assistant built using Python, designed to enhance productivity and simplify everyday computing tasks. Inspired by the fictional AI assistant Jarvis from the Iron Man series, this project combines speech recognition, text-to-speech, natural language understanding, and local large language model integration to deliver a seamless voice-controlled experience.

Core Features:
Voice & Text Interaction: Control your computer using voice commands activated by a keyboard hotkey or typed text input.
Bilingual Support: Supports English and Telugu with automatic language detection and translation for natural two-language interaction.
Smart Responses: Integrates with LM Studio‚Äôs large language models for conversational AI responses with context and coherence.
Knowledge & Information Retrieval: Quickly fetch summaries from Wikipedia on any topic.
Calculator: Safely performs arithmetic operations on demand.
Notes & Memory: Save and retrieve custom text notes or reminders locally.
Application Launch: Open system applications like Notepad and play music from your Music directory.
Weather Updates: Provides live weather data using external APIs (requires API key).
File Search: Search for files in user directories by name.
Simultaneous Speech & Text Output: Speaks replies aloud while displaying textual information instantly.

Technical Architecture:
Uses SpeechRecognition for audio input and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech output.
Language detection and optional translation handled via langdetect and deep-translator.
Local AI integration with LM Studio‚Äôs REST API enables offline large model use.
Utility functions modularized for easy extension (calculator, Wikipedia, weather, apps).
Local storage for memory uses JSON file.
Fully configurable and extendible for additional features or languages.

Use Cases:
Hands-free computer control for improved productivity and accessibility.
Voice-enabled personal assistant for general knowledge, reminders, and casual conversation.
Offline AI interactions without reliance on external cloud services.
Language inclusive assistant supporting Telugu speakers.
